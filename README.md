# Problem Statement:
The rapid growth of print and digital media increased the reach of one and all in terms of information,
resulting in more amount of Text data to be mined. This data is nothing but a heap of unclassified
information which when kept together means nothing. This means that there is a need to tag all these
data i.e. News Classification. News classification is the task of automatically classifying the news
documents into their predefined classes based on their content with the confidence learned from the
training news dataset. In many real-world scenarios, the ability to automatically classify documents into
a fixed set of categories is highly desirable. This categorization of news articles poses a significant
challenge to user-driven news applications interested in determining the interests of their users and
thereby providing the most relevant content. We aim to use machine learning to automate this process
of binning news articles into appropriate topics.

This project evaluates most widely used machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes for
automatic news classification problems. To experiment the system, a dataset from Times Group with
2,969,922 CSV Rows and three columns namely publish_date: Date of the article being published
online in yyyyMMdd format, the headline_category: Category of the headline, ascii, dot delimited,
lowercase values and the headline_text: Text of the Headline in English, only ascii characters from
2001-01-01 upto 2018-12-31. The news world is bustling every second with news entering from all
sources.
